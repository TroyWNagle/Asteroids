Sound:
  + Sometimes the theme music is very delayed when starting the game.
    + Not sure if this is because I recently deployed when I tested it or not.
    - It doesn't seem to be happening anymore.

Player:
  + Sometimes immediately gets destroyed when shooting.
    + Possible problem -> Projectile isn't moving fast enough to get out of the way of the ship when shot.
      - This shouldn't be possible though. The ships max speed is less than the projectiles speed.
    + Projectile spawns inside the ship and doesn't make it out of the ships hit box in time.
      - More likely, but I already add a slight buffer to prevent that from happening.
    - Latest fix was to decrease the overall hit box of the player ship while maintaining the visual size. Seems to have worked.

Fixed Bugs

Sound:
+ Theme music won't work any more
  + Promise error when trying to play
  + Something wrong with the file or how it is referenced
  - Downloaded a new copy of the theme music. Also added another theme song.
+ Sound for player to shoot (laser audio object), still won't work
  + Temporary fix, using the UFO shoot sound
  - Decided to stick with same laser sound.
  - Homing projectiles have a unique sound though.

Power Ups:
+ If multiple power ups are present, when you pick one
  up, all of them disappear
  + Something Probably wrong with the takePowerUp() function
  + Only happens some times...?
    - Fixed it. Splice takes an index, not an object

Mechanics:
+ Homing shot -> Struggles when multiple UFOs in scanning arc
  - Fixed as far as I can tell, And got rid of the scanning arc
  - Only searches for the closest UFO now

UFOs / Asteroids:
 + Asteroids caught by UFOs phase through each other...
  + Not really sure how to approach fixing that.
  + Will be pretty rare in an actual setting, but still.
  - Haven't seen this bug in quite some times, not sure if I indirectly fixed it or not.
  - Increased the effective mass of held asteroids to ensure they 'win' collisions.
 + UFOs catching an asteroid near the edge of the screen is problematic.
 + Since the asteroids want to wrap around, they go haywire.
  + Possible solutions:
    + Restrict the UFOs from catching the asteroids near the edge of the screen.
    + Make the UFO let go of the asteroid if that happens, simple distance check.
    - Added the distance check, and it is no longer a problem.
