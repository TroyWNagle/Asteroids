Sound:
+ Theme music won't work any more
  + Promise error when trying to play
  + Something wrong with the file or how it is referenced
+ Sound for player to shoot (laser audio object), still won't work
  + Temporary fix, using the UFO shoot sound


Power Ups:
+ If multiple power ups are present, when you pick one
  up, all of them disappear
  + Something Probably wrong with the takePowerUp() function
  + Only happens some times...?

Mechanics:
+ Homing shot -> Struggles when multiple UFOs in scanning arc
  - Fixed as far as I can tell, And got rid of the scanning arc
  - Only searches for the closest UFO now
