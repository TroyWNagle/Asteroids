Sound:
+ Theme music won't work any more
  + Promise error when trying to play
  + Something wrong with the file or how it is referenced
+ Sound for player to shoot (laser audio object), still won't work
  + Temporary fix, using the UFO shoot sound

UFOs / Asteroids:
 + Asteroids caught by UFOs phase through each other...
  + Not really sure how to approach fixing that.
  + Will be pretty rare in an actual setting, but still.
  - Haven't seen this bug in quite some times, not sure if I indirectly fixed it or not.
 + UFOs catching an asteroid near the edge of the screen is problematic.
 + Since the asteroids want to wrap around, they go haywire.
  + Possible solutions:
    + Restrict the UFOs from catching the asteroids near the edge of the screen.
    + Make the UFO let go of the asteroid if that happens, simple distance check.

Fixed Bugs

Power Ups:
+ If multiple power ups are present, when you pick one
  up, all of them disappear
  + Something Probably wrong with the takePowerUp() function
  + Only happens some times...?
    - Fixed it, I'm an idiot. Splice takes an index, not an object

Mechanics:
+ Homing shot -> Struggles when multiple UFOs in scanning arc
  - Fixed as far as I can tell, And got rid of the scanning arc
  - Only searches for the closest UFO now
