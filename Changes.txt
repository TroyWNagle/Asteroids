Homing.js:
  + Ignores asteroids, only cycles through UFOs at the moment
    + Might need to change some things to allow UFOs to shoot homing shots
  + Added Homing class that is a subclass of projectile
  + Can consistently find targets and track them
  + Can change targets and is constantly searching for closer targets
  - Has trouble letting go of targets

Game.js:
  + Minor changes, mainly for debugging the homing class
  + Right now all projectiles from the player are homing
  + Shortened spawn times of UFOs and powerups for debugging
  + Number of starting asteroids reduced to 5 from 10

Projectile.js:
  + In constructor, the direction the projectile travels in is forced to be positive
