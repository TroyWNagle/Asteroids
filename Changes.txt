Homing.js:
  + Ignores asteroids, only cycles through UFOs at the moment
    + Might need to change some things to allow UFOs to shoot homing shots
  + Added Homing class that is a subclass of projectile
  + Can consistently find targets and track them
  + Can change targets and is constantly searching for closer targets
  - Has trouble letting go of targets

Game.js:
  + Minor changes, mainly for debugging the homing class
  + Right now all projectiles from the player are homing
  + Shortened spawn times of UFOs and powerups for debugging
  + Number of starting asteroids reduced to 5 from 10

Projectile.js:
  + In constructor, the direction the projectile travels in is forced to be positive

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Math.js:
  + Added a file to handle many things related to math
    + Random Numbers, Direction between to points/vectors, collision detection

Game.js:
  - Took out the collision detection method
  + Made sure all collision detection methods are handled by Math prototypes
  - Took away game's direct control of the audio objects
  - Took out, takePowerUp function. It wasn't really helping at all.
    - I just take the power up right after detecting the collision

Asteroids.js:
  - Took out its collision detection method

AudioController.js:
  + Added an class that does nothing but control the audio objects
