Homing.js:
  + Ignores asteroids, only cycles through UFOs at the moment
    + Might need to change some things to allow UFOs to shoot homing shots
  + Added Homing class that is a subclass of projectile
  + Can consistently find targets and track them
  + Can change targets and is constantly searching for closer targets
  - Has trouble letting go of targets

Game.js:
  + Minor changes, mainly for debugging the homing class
  + Right now all projectiles from the player are homing
  + Shortened spawn times of UFOs and powerups for debugging
  + Number of starting asteroids reduced to 5 from 10

Projectile.js:
  + In constructor, the direction the projectile travels in is forced to be positive

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Math.js:
  + Added a file to handle many things related to math
    + Random Numbers, Direction between to points/vectors, collision detection

Game.js:
  - Took out the collision detection method
  + Made sure all collision detection methods are handled by Math prototypes
  - Took away game's direct control of the audio objects
  - Took out, takePowerUp function. It wasn't really helping at all.
    - I just take the power up right after detecting the collision
  + Changed how it pushes power up data to the player
  - Moved reloading control to the player ship
  + createProjectile & ufoProjectile functions both now always make the ships reload at the end
  + Allow the blue UFOs to ignore the asteroid it has caught when navigating

Asteroids.js:
  - Took out its collision detection method
  + Added variable destroyed to help the Blue UFO with letting go of destroyed asteroids

AudioController.js:
  + Added an class that does nothing but control the audio objects

Ship.js:
  + Changed how power ups and timers for them are stored
    + Using {} to store power ups and timers by key
      + Not sure if this is the best way, updating multiple powers might be a pain
      + Still using {} and now using numbers instead of strings
      + Readability is lower but it seems easier to work with.
  + Homing power up is working properly. Shots normally when it doesn't have a Homing
    power up.
  + Gave the player ship the variables to control reloading
  + Rapid fire power up working properly
  + Multiple power ups working properly
UFO.js:
  + Made its avoidance function more dynamic
    + No goes the exact opposite way of an asteroid
    + Didn't quite work with the edge detection function. But the movement of avoiding
      the edge isn't too noticeable.
  + Its ability to shoot asteroids is now regulated by its rate of fire
  + Its ability to shoot other UFOs is now regulated by its rate of fire
  + UFOs can now pick up the homing power up and use it
    + The homing projectiles only seek out the player, but can still run into anything
  + Blue UFOs can now catch asteroids and fling them at the player

PowerUp.js:
  + Added the rapid power up, cuts reload time in half
  + Adjusted the timers of bother power ups to be 15 seconds
  + Changed type from a string to a number, to use the {}

11/7/2018
---------------------------------------------------------------
UFO.js:
  + Tried to implement a pre-calculating pathfinding algorithm
    + Recursive solution didn't work, and crashed the game
    + Loop solution didn't work, and bogged down the game
  + Ended up going with a pseudo pathfinding solution
    + Gave the UFO a point to go to (power up location), will try to go but Will
      still avoid asteroids on the way
    + Every time it dodges an asteroid on the way to a power up, it has a small delay
      on trying to go towards the power up again.
    + Isn't perfect, but it works. And it will force you to find a way to beat the UFO to the power up
  + All UFOs now use the pseudo pathfinding at the beginning of their lives to get on screen.

Game.js:
  + Fixed somethings that were messing up power up pick ups.
  + Added Enter the to key map for the player boost

Ship.js:
  + Add variables to allow the player too boost (boost, boosting, MAXBOOST)
  + Updating conditionals for boosts
  + Made a TOPSPEED variable for ease of use
  + Particle trail turns blue when boosting
  + Boost regenerates at 1 per frame when not boosting and not at MAXBOOST

11/8/2018
-----------------------------------------------------------------
UFO.js:
  + Changed the alterPath function to only decrement the clock for the Orange UFOs
    + This it to allow the clock variable to also be used for the purple UFOs' ability to dodge
      projectiles.
  + Added particle effect trail.
    + The math to determine where the particles spawn doesn't make sense.
      + Since the display coordinates are upside down, I just made sure they look the way they are suppose to.
    + UFO now has a particles array to update & render its trail.
  + UFOs can pick up shields now, and they behave properly
Ship.js:
  + Added a property called shield
    + I might just make it have a timer to simplify things and add it as a powerup type
    + Just added it to the list of powerups with a really long timer.
  + Made the variable velocity into accel Because it actually is acceleration.
  + Removed the velocity variable and replaced it with velocityDirection.
    + Speed x & y are actually controlling magnitude of velocity
Game.js:
  + Added projectileDodger function to allow the purple UFOs to dodge projectiles.
    + The ability to dodge is governed by the clock property & 2 times the buffer radius to
      to allow for more consistent dodging.
    + The UFO just tries to move away from the projectile, so if the projectile is dead on target, it will still hit.
    + This is to make sure the UFO isn't too frustrating to fight.
    + Because purple UFOs are the rarest and give a life when killed, they should be the hardest to kill. Furthermore,
      it forces the player to use power ups to kill them, if they don't have the skill to shoot them down.
  + Changed the loop in the update function that handles projectile & UFO collisions. It now incorporates the
    projectileDodger function for the purple UFOs.
  - Removed the ability of the purple UFOs to shoot other UFOs. It didn't really make any sense.
    But they can still shoot other UFOs when on a collision course.
  + Changed some things to align with the new variable changes from ship.js.
  + Updated the masterReset function so I can use it for debugging
  + Added some constants to help with level scaling.
  + Added variable kills.
    + Keeps track of how many UFOs you have killed.
    + Every 5 you kill, you go up a level.
  + Level determines number of asteroids & UFO spawn times.
    + It gets crazy very quickly at the moment.

11/12/2018
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Game.js:
  + Changed the explode functions, for more varied and aggressive explosions.
  + Changed how much the asteroid constants go up per level. Was 2 * level, now it is just plus level.
  + Made changes to align with the adjustments with the UFO clocks.
  + Made changes to accommodate the fuchsia UFO
  + Added checks that make sure UFOs don't fire or throw asteroids while the player is respawning.

Particle.js:
  + Added direction variable for allowing updating speed of particles.
    + Dynamic speed of particles make the particles seem less stiff and more floaty.
  + Added an updateSpeed functions, to update x & y speeds of the particle mid flight.
  + Now speed of particles decay slightly every frame.
    + -0.05 pixels per frame to be exact.

Ship.js:
  + Changed velocityDirection back to velocity with mag & dir properties.
    + This is to allow the velocity magnitude to determine the particle trail speed of the UFOs.
    +I using it for the player too, but I didn't like how it looked.
  + Added some noise the starting angle of particles on the thruster trail.
  + Changed updateDirection to updateVelocity.
    + It now calculates the magnitude & direction of the ships velocity every frame.

UFO.js:
  + Added a function called asteroidParticles that gives caught asteroids a particle effect.
    + The particles just emit off the asteroid, but since the asteroid is always moving, the particles look like they follow the UFO.
    + But this still works because I just wanted some signifier that the UFO had control of the asteroid.
  + Made the clock variable more manageable
  + Added a function called setClock that sets the clock for UFOs of different types.
  + Added a fuchsia colored UFO that can do everything that the others can.
    + Fast firing, projectile dodging, asteroid catching, & power up stealing

11/14/2018
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Index.js:
  + Added the start of a menu
    + Only has the start button, and you can only press enter, but it does transition to starting the game well.
    + Start & Control buttons working
    +Right now only keyboard inputs work.
  + Start button now passes the canvases needed for the game to render properly.

Index.html:
  - Got rid of ui canvas element
    + Won't need it & it is very ugly.

Game.js:
  -Removed the U.I. canvas
  + Made changes to accommodate the menu passing in the canvases.
  + Made changes to accommodate the new UFO type property.
  + Made changes to accommodate the boostBar.

UFO.js:
  + Added a type property
    + So I can change the colors of the UFOs more easily.

Popup.js:
  + New Class
    + Handles displaying of small things throughout the screen to give the player feedback.
    + Things like score from destroying things, extra life, picking up power ups, & Level increases

BoostBar.js:
  + New Class
    + Handles the visual representation of the player's boost.

Ship.js:
  + Made minor adjustments to allow help the boostBar.

Particles.js:
  + Added a property decay;
    + So now I can set whether or not I want the particles to slow down.
    + Right now, only the boostBar has non-decaying particles.
  + Made all the necessary changes to other classes to accommodate this change.

Homing.js:
  + Added a past array, to keep track of where it has been for a trail effect.
  + Added a function to store the past & another to add some noise to the past.
  - Homing projectiles no longer use particles.

11/23/2018
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All:
  + Added comments to everything. Functions, Classes, certain lines of code.
  + Removed any dead chunks of code that I noticed. Only thing I know about that didn't get removed is particles.js.
