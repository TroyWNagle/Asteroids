Homing.js:
  + Ignores asteroids, only cycles through UFOs at the moment
    + Might need to change some things to allow UFOs to shoot homing shots
  + Added Homing class that is a subclass of projectile
  + Can consistently find targets and track them
  + Can change targets and is constantly searching for closer targets
  - Has trouble letting go of targets

Game.js:
  + Minor changes, mainly for debugging the homing class
  + Right now all projectiles from the player are homing
  + Shortened spawn times of UFOs and powerups for debugging
  + Number of starting asteroids reduced to 5 from 10

Projectile.js:
  + In constructor, the direction the projectile travels in is forced to be positive

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Math.js:
  + Added a file to handle many things related to math
    + Random Numbers, Direction between to points/vectors, collision detection

Game.js:
  - Took out the collision detection method
  + Made sure all collision detection methods are handled by Math prototypes
  - Took away game's direct control of the audio objects
  - Took out, takePowerUp function. It wasn't really helping at all.
    - I just take the power up right after detecting the collision
  + Changed how it pushes power up data to the player
  - Moved reloading control to the player ship
  + createProjectile & ufoProjectile functions both now always make the ships reload at the end

Asteroids.js:
  - Took out its collision detection method

AudioController.js:
  + Added an class that does nothing but control the audio objects

Ship.js:
  + Changed how power ups and timers for them are stored
    + Using {} to store power ups and timers by key
      + Not sure if this is the best way, updating multiple powers might be a pain
      + Still using {} and now using numbers instead of strings
      + Readability is lower but it seems easier to work with.
  + Homing power up is working properly. Shots normally when it doesn't have a Homing
    power up.
  + Gave the player ship the variables to control reloading
UFO.js:
  + Made its avoidance function more dynamic
    + No goes the exact opposite way of an asteroid
    + Didn't quite work with the edge detection function. But the movement of avoiding
      the edge isn't too noticeable.
  + Its ability to shoot asteroids is now regulated by its rate of fire
  + Its ability to shoot other UFOs is now regulated by its rate of fire
  + UFOs can now pick up the homing power up and use it
    + The homing projectiles only seek out the player, but can still run into anything

PowerUp.js:
  + Added the rapid power up, cuts reload time in half
  + Adjusted the timers of bother power ups to be 15 seconds
  + Changed type from a string to a number, to use the {}
