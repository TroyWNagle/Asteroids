Homing.js:
  + Ignores asteroids, only cycles through UFOs at the moment
    + Might need to change some things to allow UFOs to shoot homing shots
  + Added Homing class that is a subclass of projectile
  + Can consistently find targets and track them
  + Can change targets and is constantly searching for closer targets
  - Has trouble letting go of targets

Game.js:
  + Minor changes, mainly for debugging the homing class
  + Right now all projectiles from the player are homing
  + Shortened spawn times of UFOs and powerups for debugging
  + Number of starting asteroids reduced to 5 from 10

Projectile.js:
  + In constructor, the direction the projectile travels in is forced to be positive

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Math.js:
  + Added a file to handle many things related to math
    + Random Numbers, Direction between to points/vectors, collision detection

Game.js:
  - Took out the collision detection method
  + Made sure all collision detection methods are handled by Math prototypes
  - Took away game's direct control of the audio objects
  - Took out, takePowerUp function. It wasn't really helping at all.
    - I just take the power up right after detecting the collision
  + Changed how it pushes power up data to the player
  - Moved reloading control to the player ship
  + createProjectile & ufoProjectile functions both now always make the ships reload at the end
  + Allow the blue UFOs to ignore the asteroid it has caught when navigating

Asteroids.js:
  - Took out its collision detection method
  + Added variable destroyed to help the Blue UFO with letting go of destroyed asteroids

AudioController.js:
  + Added an class that does nothing but control the audio objects

Ship.js:
  + Changed how power ups and timers for them are stored
    + Using {} to store power ups and timers by key
      + Not sure if this is the best way, updating multiple powers might be a pain
      + Still using {} and now using numbers instead of strings
      + Readability is lower but it seems easier to work with.
  + Homing power up is working properly. Shots normally when it doesn't have a Homing
    power up.
  + Gave the player ship the variables to control reloading
  + Rapid fire power up working properly
  + Multiple power ups working properly
UFO.js:
  + Made its avoidance function more dynamic
    + No goes the exact opposite way of an asteroid
    + Didn't quite work with the edge detection function. But the movement of avoiding
      the edge isn't too noticeable.
  + Its ability to shoot asteroids is now regulated by its rate of fire
  + Its ability to shoot other UFOs is now regulated by its rate of fire
  + UFOs can now pick up the homing power up and use it
    + The homing projectiles only seek out the player, but can still run into anything
  + Blue UFOs can now catch asteroids and fling them at the player

PowerUp.js:
  + Added the rapid power up, cuts reload time in half
  + Adjusted the timers of bother power ups to be 15 seconds
  + Changed type from a string to a number, to use the {}

---------------------------------------------------------------
UFO.js:
  + Tried to implement a pre-calculating pathfinding algorithm
    + Recursive solution didn't work, and crashed the game
    + Loop solution didn't work, and bogged down the game
  + Ended up going with a pseudo pathfinding solution
    + Gave the UFO a point to go to (power up location), will try to go but Will
      still avoid asteroids on the way
    + Every time it dodges an asteroid on the way to a power up, it has a small delay
      on trying to go towards the power up again.
    + Isn't perfect, but it works. And it will force you to find a way to beat the UFO to the power up
  + All UFOs now use the pseudo pathfinding at the beginning of their lives to get on screen.

Game.js:
  + Fixed somethings that were messing up power up pick ups.
  + Added Enter the to key map for the player boost

Ship.js:
  + Add variables to allow the player too boost (boost, boosting, MAXBOOST)
  + Updating conditionals for boosts
  + Made a TOPSPEED variable for ease of use
  + Particle trail turns blue when boosting
  + Boost regenerates at 1 per frame when not boosting and not at MAXBOOST

-----------------------------------------------------------------
UFO.js:
  + Changed the alterPath function to only decrement the clock for the Orange UFOs
    + This it to allow the clock variable to also be used for the purple UFOs' ability to dodge
      projectiles.
  + Added particle effect trail.
    + The math to determine where the particles spawn doesn't make sense.
      + Since the display coordinates are upside down, I just made sure they look the way they are suppose to.
    + UFO now has a particles array to update & render its trail.
  + UFOs can pick up shields now, and they behave properly
Ship.js:
  + Added a property called shield
    + I might just make it have a timer to simplify things and add it as a powerup type
    + Just added it to the list of powerups with a really long timer.
  + Made the variable velocity into accel Because it actually is acceleration.
  + Removed the velocity variable and replaced it with velocityDirection.
    + Speed x & y are actually controlling magnitude of velocity
Game.js:
  + Added projectileDodger function to allow the purple UFOs to dodge projectiles.
    + The ability to dodge is governed by the clock property & 2 times the buffer radius to
      to allow for more consistent dodging.
    + The UFO just tries to move away from the projectile, so if the projectile is dead on target, it will still hit.
    + This is to make sure the UFO isn't too frustrating to fight.
    + Because purple UFOs are the rarest and give a life when killed, they should be the hardest to kill. Furthermore,
      it forces the player to use power ups to kill them, if they don't have the skill to shoot them down.
  + Changed the loop in the update function that handles projectile & UFO collisions. It now incorporates the
    projectileDodger function for the purple UFOs.
  - Removed the ability of the purple UFOs to shoot other UFOs. It didn't really make any sense.
    But they can still shoot other UFOs when on a collision course.
  + Changed some things to align with the new variable changes from ship.js.
  + Updated the masterReset function so I can use it for debugging
  + Added some constants to help with level scaling.
  + Added variable kills.
    + Keeps track of how many UFOs you have killed.
    + Every 5 you kill, you go up a level.
  + Level determins number of asteroids & UFO spawn times.
    + It gets crazy very quickly at the moment.
