Things to improve:
  + Increased performance by making particles an object pool?
  + U.I. is as a bare minimum right now
  + A.I. is very simplistic
    + Different colors should be more unique, either harder too kill or different attacks
  + Particles should chance color in a meaningful way
    + Fading colors, or color turning
    - Tried it, didn't really like it that much.
    - The way canvas handles rgb values isn't great
  + Need a new wav file for the theme song, got messed up somehow

Things to Add:
  + Main Menu
    + Start, Options, Controls
    + Book of Knowledge?
      + Enemy types, scoring, powerups, etc...
  + Enemy types
    + UFO that dodges?
    + UFO that has a recharging shield?
      - I think having one of the UFOs stealing powers is fine.
    + UFO that catches small asteroids and uses them as shields????
      + Could be very problematic, but really cool..
      + What happens when a carried asteroid bumps into a non carried one?
    + UFO that tries to steal powerups?
  + Power ups
    + Homing shots
      + Implementation ideas: Project a cone out from the projectile that finds a target and adjusts direction accordingly
        + Ability to change its direction must be limited
        + Ignores Asteroids
        + If it loses a target it searches for another one
    + Rapid Fire
      + Simple to implement
        + Probably need to reduce the particle trail on the projectile so it doesn't bog down the game
    + Shield
      + Ship can take a hit before being destroyed
    + Large Projectiles
      - Not sure that it would really add all that much
    + Fast Projectiles
      - Not sure that it would add all that much

Things to remove:
  + Master Reset button
    + Should just have a pause menu or something, similar to main menu

I think in terms of raw game Mechanics, I am done adding things. Time to start polishing things.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Things to Do:
  Needed sound effects:
    + Breaking a shield
    + Picking up a power up
      + Different for UFOs?
    + Asteroid breaking a power up
    + Blue UFO catching an asteroid?

  Needed/Changed visual effects:
    + Particle effect for the Blue UFO while it has an asteroid in its grasp
      - Blue & Fuchsia UFOs have particle effects on their carries asteroids.
    + Particles have a strobe effect?
    + Small particle trail for UFOs always? Similar to the player ship but more subtle.
      -I have a working particle effect for the UFOs
    + Points earned pop up where ever they were earned.
      - Added PopUp class to handle this, and it works.
    + Extra life pop ups after killing a Purple UFO
      - Added PopUp class to handle this, and it works.
    + Purple & Blue UFOs are pretty dark. Make them brighter colors?
    + Need a dynamic boost gauge
      - Added BoostBar class to handle this.
    + Need to display active powerups
    + Homing Projectiles should be unique, it is very difficult to tell what is homing & what isn't.
    + Screen Shake? Idk I don't really like screen shake too much.
      + Frame pausing on Explosions? I'm not sure how well the interval will be with that.
      + Or could just go extra crazy with the particle explosions?
        - Particle explosions are more energetic.

  Menu:
    + Start
      + immediately throws you into a game, maybe a count down?
      -Working Start button, just immediately starts.
    + Options
      + Mostly Sound
      + Change control bindings?
    + Glossary or Guide Book
      + Power Ups & descriptions
      + UFO types and behaviors
    + Control Layout
      + WASD & Arrow Keys
      + Space to shoot
      + Enter to boost
      + F to teleport
      - Controls buttons works, & displays all the controls properly.

  Structural Changes:
    + Levels
      + Determines max Asteroids & UFOs
        + Levels are determined by score milestones?
        + Levels are determined by number of UFOs Killed?
        - Levels are determined by number of UFOs killed. Currently it is every 5 kills.
      + No hard stops between levels
        + Maxes for UFOs & asteroids increase and you keep going
        - Max UFOs is locked at 5. Absolute max of asteroids is 15 (before they start breaking)
    + Asteroids
      + Asteroids should always be at max
        + If number of asteroids drops below the max, make a new one
        - If number of asteroids dip below level requirement, make a new asteroid.
        - Do the same if the number of asteroids is less than a new level's initial amount.
      + Max Asteroids will scale very slowly, & will probably cap to make it manageable.
        - Current max for asteroids, before breaking, is 15.
    + Power ups
      + No max
      + Spawn timer will scale with number of powerups in play
        + To keep things from getting too hectic or too boring
      -Currently, the timer for new power ups increase by the length of the powerups array.
      -So if there is ever more than 1 power up in play, the spawn time is drastically increased.
    + UFOs
      + Spawn timer will scale with number of UFOs in play & level
        + Higher the level, the lower the scaling
      - As levels get higher, the faster the UFOs spawn.
      - Maximum number of UFOs on screen is always 5. Might even be too high.
