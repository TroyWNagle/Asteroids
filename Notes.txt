Things to improve:
  + Increased performance by making particles an object pool?
  + U.I. is as a bare minimum right now
  + A.I. is very simplistic
    + Different colors should be more unique, either harder too kill or different attacks
  + Particles should chance color in a meaningful way
    + Fading colors, or color turning

Things to Add:
  + Main Menu
    + Start, Options, Controls
    + Book of Knowledge?
      + Enemy types, scoring, powerups, etc...
  + Enemy types
    + UFO that dodges?
    + UFO that has a recharging shield?
    + UFO that catches small asteroids and uses them as shields????
      + Could be very problematic, but really cool..
      + What happens when a carried asteroid bumps into a non carried one?
    + UFO that tries to steal powerups?
  + Power ups
    + Homing shots
      + Implementation ideas: Project a cone out from the projectile that finds a target and adjusts direction accordingly
        + Ability to change its direction must be limited
        + Ignores Asteroids
        + If it loses a target it searches for another one
    + Rapid Fire
      + Simple to implement
        + Probably need to reduce the particle trail on the projectile so it doesn't bog down the game
    + Shield
      + Ship can take a hit before being destroyed
    + Large Projectiles
    + Fast Projectiles

Things to remove:
  + Master Reset button
    + Should just have a pause menu or something, similar to main menu
